#Tools
MapSplice is downloaded from http://www.netlab.uky.edu/p/bioinfo/MapSplice2
Cufflinks is downloaded from http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cufflinks/install/



#Processing
first run 'perl get_link.pl /gscuser/mwyczalk/projects/CPTAC3/import.CPTAC3b1/BamMap/CPTAC3.b1.RNA-Seq.BamMap.dat' to generate 'to_run.sh' file

then run 'bash to_run.sh', which 1) maps fastq file to human genome using MapSplice; 2) processes bam file from MapSplice to estimate transcript expression using Cufflinks; 3) convert GTF file from Cufflinks to BED12 using custom Perl script Convert_GTF_To_Bed12.pl




#Output
Output files can be found in 'TRANSCRIPT_BED/' of each sample folder, reported in standard BED12 format with gene expression incorported in the 4th column (TranscriptID|FPKM)

Detailed about BED12 format can be found in https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html.
